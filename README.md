## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Task Management**:
  - Create, update, and delete tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed or pending.
  - Search tasks by title or description.
  - Filter tasks by status (pending/completed).
  - Sort tasks by title, date, or status.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all devices.
- **Toast Notifications**: Users receive visual feedback for actions like adding, updating, or deleting tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js (App Router)
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - React Toastify (for toast notifications)
- **Backend**:
  - Next.js API Routes
  - MongoDB (for database)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
- **Authentication**:
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - bcrypt (for password hashing)
- **Deployment**:
  - Vercel (for hosting)
  - MongoDB Atlas (for cloud database)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NeerajaGurram/todolist.git
   cd todolist
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Architecture

The project follows a modular and scalable architecture:

### Frontend
- **Pages**:
  - `home`: Displays the list of tasks with search, filter, and sort functionality.
  - `add-task`: Allows users to create a new task.
  - `edit-task/[id]`: Allows users to update an existing task.
  - `profile`: Displays and updates user profile information.
- **Components**:
  - Reusable UI components like buttons, inputs, and task cards.
- **State Management**:
  - React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing local state.

### Backend
- **API Routes**:
  - `/api/auth`: Handles user authentication (signup, login, profile).
  - `/api/tasks`: Handles CRUD operations for tasks.
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB is used to store user and task data.
  - Mongoose schemas define the structure of the data.

### Authentication
- JWT is used for secure user authentication.
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database.

## Design Decisions

1. **Next.js App Router**:
   - The App Router is used for routing, which provides better performance and flexibility compared to the Pages Router.
   - API routes are colocated with the frontend for better organization.

2. **Tailwind CSS**:
   - Tailwind CSS is used for styling due to its utility-first approach, which makes it easy to build responsive and consistent UIs.

3. **React Toastify**:
   - Toast notifications are used to provide immediate feedback to users for actions like adding, updating, or deleting tasks.

4. **MongoDB Atlas**:
   - MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud database for its scalability and ease of use.

5. **Modular Code Structure**:
   - The code is organized into reusable components and modules, making it easy to maintain and extend.
